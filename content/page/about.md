> When one comes to the topic of "Ken Moini" all considerations must be made for not only ***who*** but ***what*** is "Ken Moini" as the word ***hero*** is too narrow in scope.

So you've wandered around the property (or not) and are wondering (or not) what's the story behind this get-up.  Well friends, this here is a mix between a personal portfolio, blog, with a peppering of memes and shitposts.

Often things will be technology related, but far from limited to it - I'm a dynamic kinda guy.  My interests and talents span Web-Scale platforms, DevOps, Security, Automation, IoT, 3D Printing, Videography, Cullinary Arts, Amateur Radio, and over-engineering my Home Lab.
