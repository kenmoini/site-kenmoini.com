      <description>Every time I get on this site to try to write something and post a new blog entry, it just ends up in the Elephant Graveyard of Drafts.
I have half a dozen other posts waiting to be completed, on things such as how WordPress causes 1/3rd of the Internet to be vulnerable due to shipping old code, to a top-to-bottom view of Progressive Web Apps and Service Workers (super fun), OpenSCAP, and GPS NTP servers.</description>

      <description>Proxmox LVM Expansion, adding additional disks to your Proxmox host for VM storage. No real story behind this post, just something simple and probably more of a documentation of the process for myself more than anything.
In case you were just CRAVING the story and background behind this…well, I recently got a few new (to me) Dell R710 servers, pretty decked out. Booting Proxmox off of a 128gb USB 3.</description>

      <description>Well well well, it’s been a while y’all.
Been busy developing and writing a few things, some more exciting stuff coming up in the pipeline. A lot of the projects I’m working on have to kind of sort of “plug together” and to do a lot of this I use open-source solutions and a lot of automation. Today I’d like to show you how to setup a Linux based router, complete with packet forwarding, DHCP, DNS, and dare I even say NTP!</description>

      <description>I recently started as the Lead Solution Architect at Fierce Software. It’s been an excellent experience so far and I’m excited to be working with such a great team. At Fierce Software we help Public Sector entities find enterprise ready open source solutions. Our portfolio of vendors is deliberately diverse because in today’s enterprise multi-vendor, multi-vertical solutions are commonplace. No one’s running all Cisco network gear, Cisco servers, annnnd then what’s after that?</description>
