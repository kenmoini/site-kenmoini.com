      <description>Every time I get on this site to try to write something and post a new blog entry, it just ends up in the Elephant Graveyard of Drafts.
I have half a dozen other posts waiting to be completed, on things such as how WordPress causes 1/3rd of the Internet to be vulnerable due to shipping old code, to a top-to-bottom view of Progressive Web Apps and Service Workers (super fun), OpenSCAP, and GPS NTP servers.</description>

      <description>The other day someone asked me what I do for fun.
&amp;ldquo;Fun&amp;rdquo; really has a few different definitions for me, and I’d say for most people. It could be entertainment, guttural satisfaction, leisurely adventuring about, or maybe for some slightly compulsive people like me, accomplishing a task. Something I’m kind of overly compulsive about is proper SSL implementation and PKI.
So this morning I was having LOADS of fun. My fast just started to kick in with some of the good energy and ‘umph’ so I was feeling great.</description>
