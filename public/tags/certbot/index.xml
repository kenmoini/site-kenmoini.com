      <description>When I was at Red Hat Summit, I spent the last day in some sweatpants and meandered about the showroom floor trying to hide my Executive Exchange badge from all the sales vultures. They announced over the loudspeaker that they were closing up shop soon, and so I made my last round across the room.

      <description>The other day someone asked me what I do for fun.
&amp;ldquo;Fun&amp;rdquo; really has a few different definitions for me, and I’d say for most people. It could be entertainment, guttural satisfaction, leisurely adventuring about, or maybe for some slightly compulsive people like me, accomplishing a task. Something I’m kind of overly compulsive about is proper SSL implementation and PKI.
So this morning I was having LOADS of fun. My fast just started to kick in with some of the good energy and ‘umph’ so I was feeling great.</description>
